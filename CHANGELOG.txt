2.0.0
  - new Cloud DNS support:
    DNSZone
        provides the DNS nameServers which you must enter with your domain
        registrar as the `nameServers` attribute in runtime_properties
    DNSRecord
        represents a particular type & subnet (i.e.: [A|AAAA|MX] for www)
  - New SubNetwork node type:
    Connects to a Network node via contained_in_network relationship
    The Network node must have auto_subnets set to false
  - Network node type now suppors auto- and manual-subnet operation instead
                      of legacy networks
  - New Route node type:
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/networking#routing
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/latest/routes
    Supports nextHopIp (input directly as a parameter)
             nextHopInstance (connected_to Instance relationship)
             nextHopGateway (the default, uses the default route for the
                             network)
  - New Address node type:
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/configure-instance-ip-addresses#reservedaddress
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/latest/addresses
  - GlobalAddress node type replaces StaticIP (StaticIP kept as an alias for
              backward compatibility)
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/http/
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/latest/globalAddresses
    GlobalAddress nodes are only used together with HTTP load balancing.
  - Node Instances which map directly to a GCP entity (most of them) now
    store the entire GCP resource data in their runtime_properties.
  - Removed `resource_id` property from node types which support
    `use_external_resource`
    Rationale:
        Now that multiple regions and networks are supported, just
        supplying the name isn't sufficient to uniquely or correctly
        identify a node, so for consistency's sake it makes more sense to
        retrieve the node based on the regular properties (e.g. name,
        network, region).
        GCP doesn't use IDs of resources for anything (API related)
